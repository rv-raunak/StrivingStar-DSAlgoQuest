### âœ… Striver's Tip â€“ Clean & Logical Naming

> **"In coding rounds and interviews, always use meaningful and logical names for variables and functions.**
> Avoid generic names like `x`, `y`, or `temp` unless absolutely necessary. Clear naming shows your ability to write readable, maintainable, and professional code â€” a quality that stands out to interviewers."

ðŸ’¡ *Good naming reflects clear thinking.*
It shows you understand the **purpose** behind every part of your code â€” and that you're not just solving problems, you're building solutions.
