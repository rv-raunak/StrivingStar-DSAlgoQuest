Striver emphasizes that if you already know the optimal solution to a **hard problem**, you **should not** jump straight to it in an interview. Instead, approach it systematically. Begin by thoroughly understanding the problem—ask the interviewer about constraints, edge cases, and relevant test cases.

Start by presenting the **brute force solution**—the first idea that comes to mind, even if it's inefficient. Then, gradually build on it by suggesting a **better approach**, and finally work your way toward the **most optimal solution**. You can even add an intermediate step—something “better than better”—if it helps demonstrate your thinking more clearly.

However, this layered approach is generally recommended **only for medium to hard problems**. For **easier problems**, it’s better to get straight to the point with the optimal solution, unless specifically asked otherwise.

The key is to showcase your **logical reasoning**, **structured thinking**, and ability to improve solutions step by step. Even if you already know the answer, simulate the thought process—**fake it if you have to**—because interviewers care more about how you think than just the final output.


In short, your thought process must be visible to the interviewer
