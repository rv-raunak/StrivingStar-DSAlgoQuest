üìå Bonus Notes:
vector offers random access ‚Äî use it when you need fast reads by index. 
Random access refers to the ability to access any element directly by its index in constant time, O(1).

Avoid insert() or erase() in the middle ‚Äî shifting makes them expensive.

Best use case: append-only or read-heavy data.

/*
Earlier arrays were used to store multiple values however array has a constant size which cannot be modified after being assigned

->Vector is a container which is dynamic in nature as we can modify its size

->it stores elements in the similar fashion as the array does i.e. in continous locations in the memory

-> if there is a requirement where you don't know the size of the data structure then you can use vectors for that

//study the functions of vector in much detail as these functions will be similar in all other containers Queue, List, map, set etc.

    vector<int>:: iterator it2 = v.end();  
    //this points to the memory location just after the last element (and not at last element), we must do i-- to access the last element and then the other elements of the container

    //the rest two iterators are never used by its good to know about them
    vector<int>::reverse_iterator it3 = v.rend(); //reverse-end  (end means right after but since this is reverse so it goes to right after the first element (which actually means before))
    //this will point to the memory location just before the first element and you must i++ to access the first element

    //this will point to the memory location of the last element and it also iterates in the reverse way(right to left) you must i++ to access rest elements.
